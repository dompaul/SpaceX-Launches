# SpaceX-Launches

This is a create React application that consumes data from the SpaceX public API. The application retrieves historic and future SpaceX launches and presents them in a list view.

Stories:

- As a user, I want the ability to load the full list of SpaceX launches from the SpaceX API
- As a user, I want the ability to reload the data to see any new changes
- As a user, I want the ability to filter the launch list by year
- As a user, I want the ability to sort all launches by date (ascending/descending)

Notes:
I didn't see a mobile design in the sketch designs provided so I have just implemented a mobile version that felt right.
